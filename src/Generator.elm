The Generator Library provides an interface for generating pure pseudo-random
sequences specified by a seed. This allows for repeatable sequences.

To get started immediately, check out the Generator.Standard module which is an 
implemenation of this interface that provides an implementation of the Portable 
Combined Generator of L'Ecuyer for 32-bit computers. This implementation 
provides enough randomness for most purposes.

```
-- Create a random number generator. This must be threaded through the program.
-- This one is a "standard generator" (Generator.Standard) but other kinds of 
-- generators can be used.
gen : Generator Standard
gen = standard 42

-- Create two random integers named x and y.
(x, gen' ) = int gen
(y, gen'') = int gen'
```

The explicit use of a generator makes it possible to reproduce results
by using the same seed. In the example above the seed was 42, and every time
that code runs it will give the same values for `x` and `y`.


# Generating Numbers

All of these functions take a generator as an argument and step it forward,
returning the new version in their result. You generally should use the updated
generator for subsequent computations.

# Generators

You need a generator to actually create random values. Each generator has different
properties, so be sure to use one appropriate for your use case. If none fit your usage
you can define your own by creating somithing with the `Generator` type.

{-| Generate a 32-bit integer in range [minInt32,maxInt32] inclusive. 

A conceivable use of it would be:

      int32 gen == (42, gen')

int32 = int32Range (minInt32, maxInt32)

{-| Generate an integer in a given range. For example, the expression
`intRange (0,1) generator` will produce either a zero or a one. 

Note: the randomness is only enough for 32-bit values. Although this function 
will continue to produce values outside of the range [minInt32, maxInt32],
sufficient randomness is not guaranteed.

{-| Generator provides a common interface for number generators.
To create one, you must specify three components: next, split, range

 * The `state` field holds the current state of the generator.
 * The `next` operation returns an Int that is uniformly distributed in the
   range returned by genRange (including both end points), and a new generator.
 * The `split` operation allows one to obtain two distinct random number
   generators. This is very useful in functional programs (For example, when
   passing a random number generator down to recursive calls), but very
   little work has been done on statistically robust implementations of split.
 * The `range` operation yields the range of values returned by the generator.
